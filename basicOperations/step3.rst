In this final step, we will learn how to copy files between folders.

1. Check that you are in the home directory of your user

2. Let us copy the files in the firstLab directory to our backup. we can do this using the cp (copy) command

``cp firstLab/file1.txt backup/``\ {{execute}}

3. When copying the second file, let's give it a different name in our backup folder
``cp firstLab/file2.txt backup/file0.txt``

4. You can list the files in the backup folder to check if the files have been copied successfully

``ls backup``

5. That completes our first lab session

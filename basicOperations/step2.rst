Now that we know how to make directories, let's create files in our current folder

1. You can create an empty file using the touch command followed by a file name. Let's create two files called file1.txt and file2.txt

``touch file1.txt file2.txt``\ {{execute}}

2. Now that we have our two files, we can see the files in our directory using the ls command

``ls``\ {{execute}}

3. Now, let's go back to the root of our project folder. It is possible to go back using the cd command as such

``cd ..``\ {{execute}}


4.  Finally, letâ€™s create a second folder in our home directory called backup. We're going to use this folder to keep a backup of our firstLab

``mkdir backup``\ {{execute}}

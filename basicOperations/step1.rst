Welcome to your new environment. Let's take a look around.

1. You see your current working directory with the print working directory command

``pwd``\ {{execute}}

2. You should currently be in the home directory of your user. If not, let's switch to our project directory using the cd command 

``cd /home/student``\ {{execute}}

3. Now that we're in our working directory, let's make our first folder. We can use the mkdir command with our folder name to create a directory. Let's create a folder called firstLab

``mkdir firstLab``\ {{execute}}


4.  Finally, letâ€™s change directoryies to firstLab

``cd firstLab``\ {{execute}}
